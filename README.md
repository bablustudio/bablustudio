👋 Hi, @bablustudio here. I work at Maker Labs, an initiative of TechSoup.org and facilitate Public Good App House community events.
👀 Interested in building interfaces that facilitate dialgoue and collaborations between technical communities and people working on civil society projects. 
🌱 Currently learning that there is strong philosophical alignment between civil society makers and DWeb makers, but there are no APIs that connect these groups or projects.
💞️ Looking to connect Makers to Nonprofit leaders about potential DWeb use cases and potential DApps to improve effectiveness and resilience of civil society programs.
