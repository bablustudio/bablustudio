- 👋 Hi, I’m @bablustudio. I work at Maker Labs, an initiative of TechSoup.org and facilitate Public Good App House community events.
- 👀 I’m interested in building interfaces that facilitate dialgoue and collaborations between technical communities and people working on civil society projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that there is strong philosophical alignment between civil society makers and DWeb makers, but there are no APIs that connect these groups or projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to build a platform that enables civil society people to contribute use cases and features to public good DWeb apps.
